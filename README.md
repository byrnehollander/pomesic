Twitter bot that combines tweets to create poetry from everyday musings

Our goal is to make an entertaining Twitter bot based off of existing tweets. We intend to
combine multiple tweets to make nearly semantically coherent poems with variable structure
parameters (e.g., meter and rhyme) and tweet them. We will also try to recognize words that
aren’t in the dictionary for rhyming purposes and use tweets that rhyme and have the closest
possible semantic relationship. We will try to use the tweets that already exist (just rearranging
them to make “poetry”) or we might change words in tweets to make it rhyme using a thesaurus
(semantic distance).
